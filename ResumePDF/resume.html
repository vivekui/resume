                    It is the transition period for my entire team.

                    the changes from older version to newer version is so huge. Over the period of next 2 years, 
                    we co-ordinated with all customers and helped them migrate.

                    From we developing APIs and exposing them to customers, we pushed the entire Zoho CRM team to develop their features in APIs and use 
                    it in the web UI to render. This way we were able to build so many APIs with a single code logic for both APIs and web UI. During this
                    process, we devised various methodologies like API Audit (to make sure that the developers develop API in proper standards), common code which
                    can be made use of for easier API development etc. 
                    
                    Meanwhile, we improved our API Automation framework by building our own xml based API specification
                    format called Spec. With that, we were trying to create API Automation cases automatically and generate SDK automatically.
